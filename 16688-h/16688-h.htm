<h3>BY CHARLES FOLLEN.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>


<p>This little book is dedicated to parents and children. Most of the
poems were written with no other hope, than that they would instruct
or please some child. The pleasure they have given in a limited circle
has tempted the writer to print them. Some have never before appeared
in public, but most of them have been already published in different
works; some few, without the author's knowledge.</p>

<p>It will be found that these poems are intended for children of
different ages and characters. It may be objected to the book, that
gay and serious pieces are bound up together; but so it is in human
life and human nature, and it is essential to the healthful action of
a child's mind that it should be so. The smile that overtakes its
tears is as necessary to the child as the sun after a spring shower
is to the young plant; and without it a blight will fall upon the
opening blossom.</p>

<p>The natural love that all have for their literary offspring, perhaps,
first induced the author to bring the stray little family together.
This motive was strengthened by the hope that children might love the
book, and that she might have the pleasure of seeing it among their
treasures, with the corners of the leaves well worn by their little
fingers, and perhaps sometimes placed upon the pillow where &quot;angels
hover round.&quot;</p>

<p>This success, which must secure to her also the approbation of
parents, she does aspire after, and most earnestly desire; this, and
this alone, will satisfy her; without this, she would be the first to
pronounce it an unworthy offering.</p>

<h2>TO THE PRESENT EDITION.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>


<p>The present edition of Hymns, Songs, and Fables, has been greatly
enlarged, by poems either not before printed, or that have had a very
limited circulation, and also by a number of translations from the
German. If they should have the good fortune to add to the innocent
pleasure of the young, and deserve to become associated in their minds
with the pure and hallowed recollections of home, and happy early
days, my highest ambition with regard to them be entirely gratified.</p>

<span class="i0">Once on a time, a little bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a wicker cage was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mournful tones, these words to sing:&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&quot;In vain I stretch my useless wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still round and round I vainly fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strive in vain for liberty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear liberty, how sweet thou art!&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prisoner sings, with breaking heart:&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&quot;All other things I'd give for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ask one joy but liberty.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He sang so sweet, a little mouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who often ran about the house,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Soon as he ceased,&#8212;&quot;Suppose,&quot; said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&quot;I could contrive to set you free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would you those pretty wings give me?&quot;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cage was in the window-seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky was blue, the air was sweet.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then thus her sentiments threw out:&#8212;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Apples and cakes are better things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You love the clouds, I choose the house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wings would look queer upon a mouse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And vanished in the sky's deep blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far up his joyful song he poured,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No servants wait on lordly man<br /></span>

<span class="i0">E'en Pins and Needles are improving;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this glorious, busy day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Go forth, ye Pins, and bring home news!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye Needles in your cases muse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take me for your kind adviser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only think of growing wiser;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when you meet again, no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something you'll have to talk about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And need not get into a passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quarrel in this vulgar fashion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less of yourselves you'll think, and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of others, than you did before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll learn, that in their own right sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things with dignity appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have, when in their proper place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peculiar use and native grace.&quot;<br /></span>

<h4>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</h4>

<p>&quot;A more interesting and instructive biographical work we have never
read. High as was our opinion of Channing,&#8212;of his intellectual and
moral worth,&#8212;the perusal of this work has convinced us that we never
duly estimated him.... His letters reveal his character more fully
than his sermons and essays. In his letters he lays his heart entirely
open; and no man, no matter what his opinions or prejudices, can read
them without saying,&#8212;'Channing was, indeed, a great and good
man,&#8212;one who lived for the world!'&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Messenger.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Only one who was similar in purpose and temper,&#8212;who felt like
aspirations, hopes, and faith,&#8212;could at all do justice to the
distinguished subject. The present book must, therefore, we are sure,
give us Channing's character in its completeness, and true harmony and
proportions of parts.&quot;&#8212;<i>Salem Observer.</i></p>

<p>&quot;These memoirs of a great and good man will, we apprehend, obtain an
uncommonly extensive circulation, not only among the denomination of
Christians in which he ranked himself, but with all who reverence
purity of character, an enlarged philanthropy, and eminent talents,
guided by virtue and piety.&quot;&#8212;<i>Salem Register.</i></p>

<p>&quot;If we mistake not, now is the very time in God's providence when the
biography of William Ellery Channing could best make its appearance.
We have heard that a distinguished divine, of different speculative
religious views from Dr. Channing, has recently said,&#8212;'Channing is
greatly needed among us at this present moment.' Behold him here! We
doubt not that the biography thus prepared is to make a great
impression on the age that is passing, and that is yet to
come.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>SERMONS ON CHRISTIAN COMMUNION. Designed to promote the Culture of the
Religious Affections. Edited by Rev. <span class="smcap">T.R. Sullivan</span>. 12mo. pp.
403. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p>This work is not confined to the subject of the Lord's Supper, but
&quot;forms a series of practical discourses of the persuasive kind,
relating to repentance, or the duty of commencing the Christian
course,&#8212;to edification, or the encouragements to progressive
Christian improvement,&#8212;and to the eucharistic service, as affording
exercise for all the grateful and devout affections of the heart in
every stage of its subjection to Christian discipline.&quot;&#8212;<i>Preface.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The design of the work is admirable, and we doubt not it is admirably
executed, and will promote the best interests of our churches. We
chanced to open at Sermon XVIII., on Christian Education, and were
pleased to see the idea of Dr. Bushnell's celebrated book on
'Christian Nurture' illustrated and urged in a sermon by Dr. Putnam,
preached two years before Dr. Bushnell's book made its
appearance.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The tone of these sermons, their living interest, their
unpremeditated variety in unity, fit them well for this
purpose,&#8212;close personal influence on minds of widely differing views,
united in the one great aim of a Christian life. We shall probably
take an early opportunity of making some selections.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>&quot;We think the volume is upon the whole one of the best volumes of
discourses ever issued from the American press.&quot;&#8212;<i>Boston Daily
Atlas.</i></p>

<p>THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES, their Origin, Peculiarities, and Transmission.
By Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry A. Miles</span>. 16mo. pp. 174. Price, 50 cents.</p>

<p>This work is designed for families and Sunday Schools, and contains a
comparison of each Gospel with the education, life, and character of
its author, and with the purpose which he had in view in its
composition; as also an account of the transmission of the Gospels
down to our time, and the evidence of their uncorrupted preservation.</p>

<p>&quot;This volume by Mr. Miles has substantial value. It is by the
circulation and use of such books that Christian knowledge is to be
extended, and Christian faith confirmed. By a thorough study even of
this small work in childhood, many persons might have the satisfaction
of carrying through life a clear and connected idea of the biographies
of Jesus, and of the nature of the external evidence in their favor,
instead of remaining in vague uncertainty on the whole subject.
Bringing into a simple and popular form, and small compass,
information not hitherto accessible, except to a limited number of
persons, the 'Gospel Narratives' will be interesting to the general
reader, whether youthful or adult. It must, without doubt, be
introduced in all our Sunday Schools, and will rank among the most
important manuals.&quot;</p>

<p>NAOMI; or Boston Two Hundred Years Ago. A Tale of the Quaker
Persecution in New England. By <span class="smcap">Eliza Buckminster Lee</span>, Author
of &quot;The Life of Jean Paul.&quot; Second Edition. 12mo. pp. 324. Price, 75
cents.</p>

<p>The first edition of this popular book was exhausted within a month
after its publication.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Lee has given the public a most agreeable book. Her style is
elevated and earnest. Her sentiments, of the pure and the true. The
characters are well conceived, and are presented each in strong
individuality, and with such apparent truthfulness as almost to leave
us in doubt whether they are 'beings of the mind,' or were real men
and women who bore the parts she assigns them in those dark tragedies
that stained this 'fair heritage of freedom' in the early days of
Massachusetts.&quot;&#8212;<i>Worcester Palladium.</i></p>

<p>&quot;We have been exceedingly interested in this book, and recommend it as
a beautiful picture of female piety and quiet heroism, set in a frame
of history and tradition, that cannot fail to please every one
connected, however remotely, with the land of the Puritans. The
accomplished author of 'The Life of Jean Paul' has produced an
American novel which we should like to see followed by others
illustrative of the facts and manners of the olden time.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>THE MARRIAGE OFFERING. Designed as a Gift to the Newly-married. Edited
by Rev. <span class="smcap">A.A. Livermore</span>. 16mo. pp. 215. Price, 50 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a happy thought that suggested such a volume. We were not
aware before that there was so much and so various Christian
literature on the subject.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>MARTYRIA; a Legend, wherein are contained Homilies, Conversations, and
Incidents of the Reign of Edward the Sixth. Written by <span class="smcap">William
Mountford</span>, Clerk. With an Introduction to the American Edition,
by Rev. <span class="smcap">F.D. Huntington</span>. 16mo. pp. 348. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;The charm of the book lies in the elevated tone of thought and moral
sentiment which pervades it. You feel, on closing the volume, as if
leaving some ancient cathedral, where your soul had been mingling with
ascending anthems and prayers. There is scarcely a page which does not
contain some fine strain of thought or sentiment, over which you shut
the book that you may pause and meditate.</p>

<p>&quot;We recommend the volume to our readers, with the assurance that they
will find few works in the current literature of the day so well worth
perusal.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>&quot;This is really an original book. We have seen nothing for a long time
more fresh or true. The writer has succeeded wonderfully, in taking
himself and his readers into the heart of the age he describes. What
is more, he has uttered words and thoughts which stir up the deep
places of the soul. Let those read who wish to commune with the true
and unpretending martyr-spirit, the spread of faith and endurance,
courage, self denial, forgiveness, prayer.</p>

<p>&quot;Of all the treatises we have ever read on marriage, we have seen none
so good as one here called a 'Marriage Sermon'; not that we would ask
any couple to hear it all on their marriage day, but we commend it to
all who are married, or intend to be. The whole book is
precious.&quot;&#8212;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>&quot;There are few religious books which breathe a finer spirit than this
singular volume. The author's mind seems to have meditated deeply on
the awful realities of life. In the thoughtful flow of his periods,
and the grave, earnest eloquence of particular passages, we are
sometimes reminded of the Old English prose writers. The work is a
'curiosity' of literature, well worth an attentive
perusal.&quot;&#8212;<i>Graham's Magazine.</i></p>

<p>A TRANSLATION OF PAUL'S EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS, with an Introduction
and Notes. By <span class="smcap">William A. Whitwell</span>, Minister of the
Congregational Society in Wilton, N.H. 16mo. pp. 116. Price, 50 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;We would express a high opinion of the book, and can assure the
Christian reader who will compare it carefully with our common
version, that he will rise up from the joint perusal of the two with a
better understanding of Paul than he had before.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian
Register.</i></p>

<p>CHRISTIANITY THE DELIVERANCE OF THE SOUL AND ITS LIFE. By <span class="smcap">William
Mountford</span>. With an Introduction by Rev. <span class="smcap">F.D. Huntington</span>.
16mo. pp. 118. Price, 37-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Mountford is full of warm religious feeling. He brings religion
home to the heart, and applies it as the guide of the life.&quot;&#8212;<i>London
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>SELF-FORMATION; or the History of an Individual Mind: Intended as a
Guide for the Intellect through Difficulties to Success. By a Fellow
of a College. 12mo. pp. 504. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p>&quot;The publishers have done good service by bringing forward an American
edition of this work. It may be most unreservedly recommended,
especially to the young.&quot;&#8212;<i>Daily Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Your gift of 'Self-Formation' is truly a welcome one, and I am
greatly obliged to you for it. It is a work of quite original
character, and I esteem it (in common with all I know of, who have
read it) as possessed of very rare merit. I am glad, for the cause of
good education and sound principle, that you have republished it, and
I wish every young man and woman in the community might be induced to
read it carefully. It is several years since I looked into it in the
English edition,&#8212;but I yet retain a vivid impression of the great
delight it afforded me, and I shall gladly avail of the opportunity of
renewing it.&quot;&#8212;<i>Extract from a Letter.</i></p>

<p>&quot;This is emphatically a good book, which may be read with profit by
all classes, but more especially by young men, to whose wants it is
admirably adapted. The American editor is no doubt right in saying,
that it is almost without a question the most valuable and useful work
on self education that has appeared in our own, if not in any other
language.&quot;&#8212;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>THOUGHTS ON MORAL AND SPIRITUAL CULTURE. By Rev. <span class="smcap">Robert C.
Waterston</span>. Second Edition, revised. 16mo. pp. 302. Price, 62-1/2
cents.</p>

<p>This book has met with a ready sale in this country, and has been
republished in England. A London periodical, in reviewing it,
says:&#8212;&quot;We will venture to predict that it will soon take its place on
the shelves of our religious libraries, beside Ware 'On the Christian
Character,' Greenwood's 'Lives of the Apostles,' and other works to
which we might refer as standard publications, the value of which is
not likely to be diminished by the lapse of time or the caprices of
fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The sense of duty in parents and teachers may be strengthened and
elevated by contemplating the high standard which is here held up to
them. The style has the great merit of being an earnest one, and there
are many passages which rise into genuine eloquence and the glow of
poetry.&quot;&#8212;<i>N.A. Review.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The Lecture 'On the Best Means of exerting a Moral and Spiritual
Influence in Schools,' no teacher, male or female, possessed of any of
the germs of improvement, can read without benefit.&quot;&#8212;<i>Hon. Horace
Mann, Secretary of the Board of Education.</i></p>

<p>DOMESTIC WORSHIP. By <span class="smcap">William H. Furness</span>, Pastor of the First
Congregational Unitarian Church in Philadelphia. Third Edition. 12mo.
pp. 272. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;We are glad to see this book. It is a work of great and peculiar
excellence. It is not a compilation from other books of devotion; nor
is it made up of conventional phrases and Scripture quotations, which
have been so long employed as the language of prayer, that they are
repeated without thought and without feeling. It is admirably adapted
to the purpose for which it was written; and it may be read again and
again with great interest and profit by any one, who desires to enrich
his mind with the purest sentiments of devotion, and with the language
in which it finds its best expression. Here we have the genuine
utterances of religious sensibility,&#8212;fresh, natural, and original, as
they come from a mind of singular fertility and beauty, and a heart
overflowing with love to God and love to man. They seem not like
prayers made with hands, to be printed in a book, but <i>real praying</i>,
full of spirit and life.... So remarkable is their tone of reality and
genuineness, that we cannot bring ourselves to regard them as
compositions written for a purpose, but rather as the actual
utterances of a pure and elevated soul in reverent and immediate
communion with the Infinite Father.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>LAYS FOR THE SABBATH. A Collection of Religious Poetry. Compiled by
<span class="smcap">Emily Taylor</span>. Revised, with Additions, by <span class="smcap">John
Pierpont</span>. 16mo. pp. 288. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;It is simple and unpretending: and though some of the pieces are
probably familiar to most readers, they all breathe a pure and
elevated spirit, and here and there is an exquisite effusion of
genius, which answers to the holiest wants of the soul.</p>

<p>&quot;Not only great pleasure may be derived from such a volume, but
lasting and useful impressions. Many are keenly alive to the harmony
of verse and the fresh outbursts of poetic feeling, who would pore
with delight over such a volume, and many might thus be won to high
thought and serious reflection.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>THE YOUNG MAIDEN. Seventh Edition. By Rev. <span class="smcap">A.B. Muzzey</span>,
Author of &quot;The Young Man's Friend,&quot; &quot;Sunday School Guide,&quot; etc., etc.
16mo. pp. 264. Price, 62-1/2 cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contents.</span>&#8212;The Capacities of Woman; Female Influence; Female
Education; Home; Society; Love; Single Life; Reasons for Marriage;
Conditions of True Marriage; Society of Young Men; First Love; Conduct

<p>&quot;The sentiments and principles enforced in this book may be safely
commended to the attention of women of all ranks. Its purpose is
excellent throughout; and as it is everywhere governed by a just and
amiable spirit, we believe it is calculated to do much good.&quot;&#8212;<i>London

<p>&quot;The author has been for a long period engaged in the cause of which
he has now become the historian; and if ardor, perseverance, and
faithfulness in that service qualify him to write its history, we know
of no one to whom it could have been more properly

<p>THOUGHTS; selected from the Works of <span class="smcap">William Ellery Channing</span>,
D.D. 32mo. pp. 160. Price, 37-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a diamond of a volume, the purpose of which is well expressed
in the following 'thought' from Channing, which is put on the
title-page:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;'Sometimes a single word, spoken by the voice of genius, goes far
into the heart. A hint, a suggestion, an undefined delicacy of
expression, teaches more than we gather from volumes of less gifted
men.'</p>

<p>&quot;Those who differ in theological views from the gifted Channing will
of course find many thoughts in this little volume not to their taste.
But those to whom any theological views have ever done much good will
nevertheless prize the book for its thoughts. Thoughts they are, not
faint reflections of thought. And those who would be wise above all
things prize to know what can be thought on all sides of every
important subject. To enrich our columns we borrow a gem or
two.&quot;&#8212;<i>Chronotype.</i></p>

<p>&quot;A collection of noble thoughts, that may well take its place by the
side of the celebrated thoughts of Pascal, which have in them more of
metaphysics, but less that touches the human heart. It makes a
beautiful pocket volume.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>&quot;We have long desired to see a book of this kind, and now, from a
slight examination, believe that it is well done. It is a beautiful
collection of beautiful thoughts, and must be a welcome possession,
not only for all who agree with Dr. Channing in his peculiar religious
opinions, but for all who value lofty sentiments worthily expressed,
and who by the influence of such thoughts would be strengthened to
duty, or raised to a higher sphere of contemplation.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian
Register.</i></p>

<p>DAVID ELLINGTON. By Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Ware, Jr.</span> With other Extracts
from his Writings. 18mo. pp. 192. Price, 37-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ware has left very few things which will do so much towards
promoting the great object for which he lived and labored. The simple
story of the every-day life of a good man, told as these stories are
told, finds a response in the hearts of those most indifferent to the
great concerns of virtue and religion; it reaches and touches what
nothing else, not the eloquent preaching of an apostle, could reach
and touch.&quot;</p>

<p>CHRISTIAN CONSOLATIONS. Sermons designed to furnish Comfort and
Strength to the Afflicted. By Rev. <span class="smcap">A.P. Peabody</span>, Pastor of
the South Church, Portsmouth, N.H. 16mo. pp. 320. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;We welcome with almost as much surprise as satisfaction the
appearance of a volume of discourses as excellent as those of Mr.
Peabody. They are rich in thought, and of a high order of literary
merit.&quot;&#8212;<i>N.A. Review.</i></p>

<p>THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD. By <span class="smcap">A.B.
Jacocks</span>. 16mo. pp. 94. Price, 37-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE: with an Outline of
some of its recent Developments among the Germans, embracing the
Philosophical Systems of Schelling and Hegel, and Oken's System of
Nature. By <span class="smcap">J.B. Stallo, A.M.</span>, lately Professor of Analytical
Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Chemistry in St. John's College,
N.Y. 12mo. pp. 532. Price, $1.25.</p>

<p>&quot;It grapples with the most abstruse problems, and tugs fiercely to
pluck out the heart of their mystery. No difficulty is too great for
the author to meet, and none seems able to upset his theory. In truth,
the book is one of the most profound ever published in Boston, and
whatever opinion may be given regarding its principles, none can
gainsay its vigor of understanding and reach of learning. The
pertinent question, Who reads an American book? will change somewhat
its meaning, if American literature takes the abstruse direction
indicated by Mr. Stallo's volume. In that event, our books will remain
unread, not because they are too shallow, but because they are too
deep.&quot;&#8212;<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

<p>MORNING AND EVENING MEDITATIONS, for every Day in a Month. By <span class="smcap">Miss
Carpenter</span> (daughter of the late Dr. Lant Carpenter). 16mo. pp.
312. Price, 62-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>&quot;The compiler of this work has rendered good service to all possessed
of Christian sympathies.&quot;&#8212;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>&quot;We like its spirit, and believe it will prove an excellent closet
companion for those who will faithfully use it.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian
Register.</i></p>

<p>THE WORDS OF CHRIST; from the New Testament. 16mo. pp. 150. Price, 50
cents.</p>

<p>&quot;The compiler has most happily collected the words of Christ, so that,
by the slightest reference possible to the tables, every text is
ascertained under the several heads. It will prove very beneficial to
the Biblical scholar, clergyman, and Sunday-school
teacher.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>POPULAR OBJECTIONS TO UNITARIAN CHRISTIANITY CONSIDERED AND ANSWERED.
In Seven Discourses. By Rev. <span class="smcap">George W. Burnap</span>. 16mo. pp. 166.
Price, 37-1/2 cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contents</span>.&#8212;The Position of Unitarianism defined. Unitarians
not Infidels. Explaining the Bible and Explaining it away.
Unitarianism not mere Morality. Unitarianism Evangelical Christianity.
Unitarianism does not tend to Unbelief. Dr. Watts a Unitarian.</p>

<p>&quot;These topics Mr. Burnap treats with a freshness of thought which will
render the volume acceptable to those who have a taste for reading of
this sort, while its general merits place it in the class of works one
would wish to see extensively circulated among those who think that
Unitarianism has nothing to stand upon, or that it is a doctrine full
of impiety.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>THE MISCELLANEOUS WRITINGS OF F.W.P. GREENWOOD, D.D. 12mo. pp. 400.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a profitable book for any one to read,&#8212;partly because it
communicates information and offers instruction, but chiefly because
its moral tone is of the healthiest kind.&quot;&#8212;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>CHRISTIAN HYMNS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WORSHIP. A Collection compiled
by a Committee of the Cheshire Pastoral Association. Twenty-eighth
Edition. 18mo. pp. 562. Price, 50 cents.</p>

<p>Although this book has been published but four years, it is now used
in <i>forty</i> societies, and this fact is considered sufficient to show
the estimation in which it is held, and the manner in which it has
stood the test of comparison with other collections.</p>

<p>The following are some of the peculiar merits of the Christian
Hymns:&#8212;the number of hymns is very large; the variety of subjects and
metres is very great; the hymns are better adapted for singing; the
plan of arrangement is improved; and the price is very low.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
